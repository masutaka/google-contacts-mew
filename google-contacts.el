;;
;; Version 0.2.2-alpha
;; - Fetch contacts from Google using GData APIs in JSON format.
;; - Support for merging fetched contacts with BBDB.
;;
;; Basic usage:
;; - Set variables `google-contacts-email' and `google-contacts-passwd'.
;; - Call function `google-contacts-retrieve'.
;;   It returns a simple Lisp structure which should contain all your contacts.
;;
;; Be careful with the `google-contacts-merge-with-bbdb' function. It will
;; replace all contacts you have in your BBDB address book for which there
;; exists a Google contact, with only data from the Google contact. This is
;; because I mostly edit contacts in GMail and just export to BBDB when
;; necessary, using this function. Also bear in mind that this is *alpha* code,
;; tailored to my own needs. It was written using Emacs 23, your milage may vary
;; if you're using a different Emacs flavour or version.
;;
;;** BACKUP YOUR BBDB DATABASE BEFORE TESTING THIS FUNCTION **
;;
;; TODO Document Lisp structure returned from `google-contacts-retrieve'
;; TODO General clean up, clean up BBDB merge code.
;;
;; Changelog:
;; * v0.2.2-alpha, 2010-11-28
;;   Add explicit requirement on common lisp extensions.
;; 
;; * v0.2.1-alpha, 2010-10-13
;;   Fixed problem with contacts that have no emails and zero-length title/name
;;   string.
